## Subject
### Novel method for annotating gene targets to GWAS loci

## Description
In this thesis we develop an iterative method using the expectation-maximization algorithm to annotate genes to SNPs.
Two version were made. One using dictionaries in "EM_without_DB" and one using a database in "DB_EM".
The thesis itself was based on "DB_EM".
## Usage
User must provide lead SNPs in bed format and background genes in "DB_EM.py". A text file with background genes is provided as "background_amiGO2_ids.txt".
